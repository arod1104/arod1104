### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Illinois at Chicago, eager to explore opportunities where I can contribute and further enhance my skills. If you're reading this, chances are you're probably part of the talent aquisition team looking to take a glimpse at my portfolio.

### Although I am unable to show you most of my University projects due to copyrighted material, I would like to give you a quick introduction about me and what my goals are for the near future.

---

#### - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my personal website. This platform will not only showcase my portfolio of past and upcoming projects (including being able to write in a custom made language I made during my time in college) but also feature my resume, detailing my work experience and skills.

---

#### - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m consistently learning new technologies and best practices in software development to keep my skills sharp and up-to-date. Right now, I am learning more about front end technologies such as React and Bootstrap to give my upcoming personal website some personality. I also plan on learning back-end technologies such as Go, Docker, and AWS, where I plan on giving people the opportunity to experiment with my own programming language also known as Albatross.

---

#### - ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects of my interest and innovative tech ideas that aim to solve real-world problems. I am a big fan of video games, and contributing to open source emulators has been a goal of mine.

---

#### - ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to my projects or experiences. I'm always open to discussing tech and potential opportunities.

---

#### - ðŸ“« How to contact me: Feel free to send me an email which is arodriguez11400@gmail.com or visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arodriguez11400/) page and send me a message there. I am currently in the search for an entry level software engineering/developer position so please don't hesitate to reach out.
